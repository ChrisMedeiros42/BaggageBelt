## Primary Objective
The player must transfer all the luggage from the baggage trucks to the conveyor belts for their respective planes before time runs out.

## How to Win
Players do not lose in this score-based game, but they do earn points for how well they perform. The more luggage the player loads on the planes correctly, the higher the score.

## Detailed Description
When the game starts, a baggage handler drives a baggage truck to the conveyor belt for a plane preparing for departure. Our luggage hero steps up to the truck and prepares for the loading process. A sponsor-hosted timer will appear at the top of the screen and display a series of messages for the player to get read: “Ready! … Set! … Go!” The player proceeds to load as many pieces of luggage on the appropriate planes as possible before the timer runs out. Upon completion, players may input their two-letter initials to record their score.

## Gameplay
- To play, the player grabs a piece of luggage and places it on the conveyor belt for the matching plane.
- Each piece of luggage will have a color and shape to identify which plane it needs to be loaded on.
- If all pieces of luggage are loaded onto the conveyor belt prior to the timer reaching zero, a “Great Job!” message will appear, sending the player to the next level.
- If leftover luggage remains on the baggage truck when the timer reaches zero, a “Have to move faster” message will appear, giving the player the option to record their score and try again from the beginning.

### Additional Levels
- Levels 1, 2, and 3: Each additional level will have more baggage to place on the conveyor belt. The baggage truck will automatically move forward to the next cart filled with baggage as the player empties a previous car.
- Levels 4, 5, and 6: Each level adds an additional belt and adds the features of levels 1-3, starting with less luggage on level 4 and increasing with each additional level.
    - Indicating to the player which conveyor belt to place the luggage on, each plane will have a number that counts down with each piece of luggage placed on the belt going to it, until the number reaches zero. The plane will also have matching colored shapes to the shapes on the luggage.
    - If luggage is placed on the conveyor belt to a plane with a zero, it will get kicked back to the baggage truck to be placed again on another conveyor belt for a plane awaiting luggage, displaying a message of, “This plane is full.”
    - If luggage is placed on a conveyor belt to a plane with a different colored shape, it will get kicked back to the baggage cart with the message, “Colors and shapes must match.”
